# Ephrem Alem's Data Analytics Portfolio

Hello! I'm Ephrem Alem, an aspiring Data Analyst with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools such as Tableau and Power BI. I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Montgomery College, Rockville, Maryland.

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks that I created for data analysis or for the exploration of data preprocessing and analytics concepts. A separate section is dedicated to projects, where I solved interesting real-world problems using data.

## Projects

- [Italy_BES](https://github.com/EphiWalker/Italy_BES): A data analysis and visualization project about Italy's well-being measurement dataset. The project aimed to determine which region is most suitable for visiting and which one is better for living in for about a year.
- [BRFSS_Health](https://github.com/EphiWalker/BRFSS_Health): A data analysis project based on data from the CDC to determine what kind of habits/behaviors are the most risky for people's health, and how those behaviors are distributed over gender and age.
